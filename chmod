## chmod - Change File Modes

NAME
    chmod - change the access permissions of file(s) and directory(ies)

SYNOPSIS
    chmod [OPTION]... MODE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
    The chmod command is used to change the permissions of files and directories. Permissions determine who can read, write, or execute a file.

    Permissions are represented in three sets:
    - Owner (the person who created the file)
    - Group (users in the same group as the owner)
    - Others (everyone else)

    Each set of permissions can be specified using either symbolic notation (e.g., u+r) or numeric notation (e.g., 755).

OPTIONS

    -R, --recursive
        Recursively change permissions of directories and their contents.

        Example:
           # chmod -R 755 mydir
            This command sets the permissions of mydir and all files and subdirectories within it to 755.

    --reference=RFILE
        Set permissions of the target file(s) to be the same as those of RFILE.

        Example:
            #chmod --reference=example.txt targetfile.txt
            This command sets the permissions of targetfile.txt to match those of example.txt.

    MODE
        The mode defines the new permissions. You can specify modes in two ways:

        Symbolic Mode
            - u: User (owner)
            - g: Group
            - o: Others
            - a: All (u+g+o)
            - +: Add permission
            - -: Remove permission
            - =: Set exact permission

            Examples:
                Add read permission for the user:
                    # chmod u+r file.txt
                Remove write permission for the group:
                    # chmod g-w file.txt
                Set exact permissions for others:
                    #chmod o=rx file.txt

        Numeric Mode
            Use a three-digit number where each digit represents permissions for user, group, and others respectively. Each digit is the sum of:
            - 4: Read (r)
            - 2: Write (w)
            - 1: Execute (x)

            Examples:
                Set permissions to read, write, and execute for the owner; read and execute for group and others:
                    chmod 755 file.txt
                Set permissions to read and write for everyone:
                    chmod 666 file.txt
                Set permissions to read, write, and execute for owner, and read and execute for group and others:
                    chmod 755 myscript.sh

EXAMPLES

    Make a script executable:
        # chmod +x script.sh
        This adds execute permission for everyone.

    Set permissions for a directory and its contents:
        # chmod -R 700 mydir
        This sets read, write, and execute permissions for the owner only.

    Remove read permission for others:
        # chmod o-r file.txt

    Set exact permissions using numeric mode:
        #chmod 644 file.txt
        This sets read and write permissions for the owner and read-only for group and others.
