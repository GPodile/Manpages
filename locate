LOCATE(1)  
NAME  
locate - find files by name

SYNOPSIS  
locate [OPTION]... PATTERN...

DESCRIPTION  
locate is a command-line utility that searches for files in a pre-built database of filenames and paths. It quickly finds files by matching the specified PATTERN against the database entries.

The locate command relies on its database, which contains a snapshot of the filesystem. To ensure the database is up-to-date with the current state of the filesystem, you should regularly run the updatedb command. The updatedb command updates the database with the latest information about files and directories.

OPTIONS  
-i, --ignore-case  
  Perform a case-insensitive match.  
  Example: `locate -i config`  
  This will find files with `config`, `Config`, `CONFIG`, etc.

-r, --regex=PATTERN  
  Use a regular expression for matching filenames.  
  Example: `locate -r '\.log$'`  
  This will find files that end with `.log`, such as `error.log` or `debug.log`.

-e, --existing  
  Only show results for files that currently exist on the filesystem.  
  Example: `locate -e backup`  
  This will list only those files containing `backup` that currently exist on the filesystem.

-l, --limit=NUMBER  
  Limit the number of matches shown to NUMBER.  
  Example: `locate -l 10 config`  
  This will display only the first 10 matches for files containing `config`.

-n, --names-only  
  Only show file names without their directory paths.  
  Example: `locate -n report`  
  This will display just the file names containing `report`, without showing their directory paths.

-c, --count  
  Show the number of matching entries instead of the matches themselves.  
  Example: `locate -c backup`  
  This will output the count of files containing `backup`, rather than listing them.

-h, --help  
  Display this help message and exit.  
  Example: `locate -h`  
  This will show a brief help message about the `locate` command.

-V, --version  
  Display version information and exit.  
  Example: `locate -V`  
  This will show the version of the `locate` command.

EXAMPLES  
1. To find all files with `config` in their name:  
   `locate config`

2. To find files with `README` in their name, case-insensitively:  
   `locate -i README`

3. To find files matching a regular expression, such as files ending with `.log`:  
   `locate -r '\.log$'`

4. To count the number of files that contain `backup` in their name:  
   `locate -c backup`  
   This will show only the number of files containing `backup` rather than listing each file.

5. To show only the names of files (without paths) that contain `report`:  
   `locate -n report`

6. To limit the number of matches shown to 5 for files containing `data`:  
   `locate -l 5 data`

7. To filter results to only those files that currently exist on the filesystem:  
   `locate -e temp`

FILES  
/var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db  
  Default location of the locate database.
